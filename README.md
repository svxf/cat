a random file host thing i made

i dont suggest to actually use this
it was just a random project i made to not spend the time having to upload large files to things like google drive so my friends could download
this project requires hamachi or something like that (hamachi is preferable rather than localtunnel or ngrok since it lowers the download speed)

this project is coded really bad and yeah thats it bye ðŸ‘‹
