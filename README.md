 a random file host thing i made

basically my thought process behidn this was like:
hmm i wonder if i could just make a program which lets my friends download files off of my computer instead of me having to upload it to a separate site like google drive or something
and it did work but i realized the download speed is super slow since i was using something like localtunnel and ngrok, and i didnt want to pay for a server or use my public ip.
but after some testing i figured out it worked with hamachi and the download speed was pretty fast for other people

this project is coded really bad and yeah thats it bye ðŸ‘‹
